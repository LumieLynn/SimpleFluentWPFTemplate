# SimpleFluentWPFTemplate
A simple Fluent style WPF Template with a NavigationView using 'iUWM'([iNKORE.UI.WPF.Modern](https://github.com/iNKORE-NET/UI.WPF.Modern/)).
This is a training project. The template adopts the MVVM architectural pattern, however the navigation component needs ongoing improvements to meet production-ready standards.
